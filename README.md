# Deep_project

To train the VGGNet implementation, run VGGNetV2.py
To train the ResNet implementation, run ResNetV3.py
To train the Attention Augmented Resnet implementation, run AAResNetV2.py
AAResNetV2.py also requires attention_augmentation.py, where the methods and functions for attention augmentation is defined.
